# WiDS-2022
A Python code for machine learning on WiDS 2022 dataset.
All the dataset and information with respect to the analysis were obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2022/overview
### Objective
To predict building energy usage, using given building information and other related georaphical and climatic factors. The dataframe inculdes information about the monthly min, max and avg temperatures, year of construction of building, the type of facility, snow levels, precipitaion, wind directions, days with fog, heating days and cooling days. Given the information, we will be performing an EDA to undertand the training data and further clean the dataset for missing values. Next, we will be performing Linear Regression to identify the significant variables which will predict the Site Energy Utilisation Index in the test data set.
